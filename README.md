# coach-ai - Automate, Recommend, Guide

The Team: Isaac, Kit and Tom.

This is our college final year project on the theme "mobile app on Health and Well-being". The app aims to serve as a proof of concept for improving current mobile fitness applications. Our app contains the following features often neglected by current solutions:

1. Reading inputs of diet & exercise logs from multiple means. (Manual data entry, food image recognition & logging workouts after completion).

2. Complementary Diet & Exercise recommendations. (Weekly exercise plan + dynamic diet recommendations)

3. Exercise pose recognition + real time voice feedback.

If you would like to try it out, please feel free to use your own api keys for:

1. Google Firebase (Prolly you have to use ours)

2. Spoonacular

P.S. If you see this, have a good day! :)
